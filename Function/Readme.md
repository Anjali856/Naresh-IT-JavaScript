# ğŸ”¢ Find Missing Number in an Array (JavaScript)

## ğŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project provides a **JavaScript solution** to find the missing number(s) in a continuous array of numbers. It handles two scenarios:
1. Array starting from 1 (or any number) with exactly **one missing number**.
2. Array with **any starting number and range**, including cases where multiple numbers might be missing.
